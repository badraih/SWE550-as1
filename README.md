develop a Docker Compose environment to configure and 
run multiple Docker containers in your local environment. For this task, you have the 
choice of selecting the programming language you are comfortable with and the database 
management system of your choice. For instance, a web application in one container 
developed using Spring Boot (Java) or Python communicating with a PostgreSQL 
container.
Requirements: 
ü The assignment code should be pushed into Github. You only need to submit the 
repository link. 
ü The name of the project (repo name) should be “SWE550-as1”. 
ü You will need to install Docker and Docker Compose on your local environment. 
There are many guides that help you to do that.
ü You can use Kafka as a medium of communication or Rest-APIs. Postman is an 
API client used by developers to create, test, document, and share APIs. You 
might find it useful to develop and test your APIs. 
ü The database can have one table with any number of columns, with few rows. 
ü The web application needs to have a UI with two requirements: 
o An input field to input the number of rows the use wants to pull from the 
database. A submit button that fetches the data from the database container
and display back the results.
o You can assume the database name and tables are hardcoded to speed up 
the development process. 
o The web-application needs to be dockerized as well as the database. 
ü You need to include in the repository a Readme file that describes the project, the 
framework/language used, the database used, and the database schema assumed.
